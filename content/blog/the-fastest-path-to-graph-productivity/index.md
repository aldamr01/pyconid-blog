As the most trusted, scalable, high-performance graph
data platform on the market, Neo4j empowers developers
and data scientists to create intelligence-powered
solutions. Now you can overcome the most complex data
challenges with advanced applications that harness the
rich relationships in your data.

The Neo4j Graph Database is the heart of the [Neo4j Graph
Data Platform](https://neo4j.com/product/?ref=product-brief-graph-database). 
Neo4j is the most widely deployed graph
database, serving enterprise use cases across industries,
including life sciences, utilities, financial services,
cybersecurity, and [so many more](https://neo4j.com/customers/?ref=product-brief-graph-database).

## Key Benefits of Neo4j Graph Database

### Graph-Native Scale

Neo4j’s high-performance, ACID-compliant distributed
cluster architecture scales with your data and your
business needs, minimizing cost and hardware while
maximizing performance across connected datasets
without compromising data integrity.

With Neo4j, businesses achieve robust transactional
guarantees and performance across billions of nodes
and trillions of relationships, with query response time in
milliseconds. Analytical workloads can achieve unlimited
scale-out for reads with a single core server and as many
read replicas as desired. Scale reads horizontally 1000x
simply by adding more read replicas.

The Neo4j Graph Database gives you unlimited horizontal
scalability by enabling you to divide your graph into shards.
Shards partition data onto different servers as desired
based on business needs, geography, or latency for users.

> Head of Management Information Systems,
> Hillside Technology Ltd.

Federated native graph queries analyze the graph as a
logical whole using [Neo4j Fabric](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/fabric/?ref=product-brief-Neo4j-graph-database).

### Superior Performance

Graph databases are like rocket fuel for intelligent
applications, delivering context fast, even for the
deepest queries. Neo4j’s native graph database delivers
constant high-performance queries, no matter how large
your graph is.

Relationship and relationship property indexes triple the
speed of deep queries. Relationship chain locks enable
faster transaction writes to create, delete, and update
dense nodes (nodes with many relationships).

### Operational Flexibility

Business requirements and priorities change – and
Neo4j is built to keep pace. Neo4j pioneered the
property graph model; the model you sketch on a
whiteboard is the same as the data stored in the
database. This intuitive, concept-first approach spurs
rapid development of intelligence-driven applications.
As business requirements change, modify the schema or
database without disrupting or remodeling current data.

### Designed for the Cloud

Neo4j runs everywhere: on-premises and across public,
private, and hybrid clouds. About 90 percent of enterprise
customers deploy Neo4j in the cloud. Neo4j is designed for
ease of operations in cloud architecture so you can build,
test, and deploy faster.

With [Neo4j Aura](https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/?ref=product-brief-graph-database), 
the fully managed cloud offering,
developers get started immediately, with zero
administration. Neo4j Aura scales to meet the most
demanding production workloads. Neo4j makes application
development, deployment, and DevOps even simpler
with Kubernetes integration and Helm Charts, as well as
simplified server-side routing.

### Fine-Grained Security

Built for the graph, Neo4j includes enterprise-grade
database security that guarantees transactions with
zero data loss. Neo4j has all the security features that
enterprises demand: LDAP/Directory services integration,
security logging, and strong encryption to protect data in
transit and at rest.

Role-based access control enables fine-grained governance
of all nodes, properties, and relationships. Securing data at
the database level empowers developers to focus on the
functionality of their intelligent applications. It also allows
organizations to create logical security roles for all users.

### Developer Friendly

Neo4j has the largest active developer community, with
over 220,000 members. The Cypher graph query language
is compact and intuitive, requiring 10x less code than
SQL. Cypher delivers massive productivity gains with a
minimal learning curve. Features like indexes on node and
relationship types and properties make complex Cypher
queries even faster.

A combination of client- and server-side routing makes
it easy for DevOps teams to roll out Neo4j with load
balancers, orchestration platforms like Kubernetes,
application stacks like GRANDstack, and client tools like
[Neo4j Bloom](https://neo4j.com/product/bloom/?ref=product-brief-graph-database), 
[Neo4j Browser](https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-browser/?ref=product-brief-graph-database), 
and Jupyter Notebooks.
